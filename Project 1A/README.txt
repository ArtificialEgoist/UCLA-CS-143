I am not working with anyone at the moment. 

How I did Project 1A:
--------------------
Originally, I approached this problem from a regular expression point of view. However, I stumbled upon the @ hint on Piazza given by a TA, and I used that instead to do a majority of the eval error checking. I kept some of the primitive regex matching (such as restricting the characters to only numbers, the four basic operators, and a decimal point, or finding divide-by-zero cases) to remind myself of the potential usefulness of regex in the future.
