I am not working with anyone at the moment. 

Project 1C
--------------------
I believe my project follows the specifications completely and satisfies all functionality requirements.
The entire development of my site was done using Firefox (however, it also seems to work on IE).
All the Selenium test cases ran perfectly for me, as did my own test cases (such as checking for escape chars, etc.)

The basic design of my MovieDB site was inspired by the Chu-Cheng's demo site. 
I changed the UI quite a bit to make it easier on the eyes and more intuitive for users.
My site includes the same pages as the demo sites, but rather than using frames, I adopted a "top-navigation" bar using an HTML table. 

These are my pages:
-Add Actor/Director: allows user to add actor or director to table
-Add Movie Info: allows user to add movie to table
-Add Movie Comment: allows user to select any movie from dropdown box and rate/comment on it
-Add Movie Actor: allows user to link existing movies/actors
-Add Movie Director: allows user to link existing directors/actors
-Show Actor Info: initalizes with "invalid ID" message, but given the URL id input, it shows actor details
-Show Actor Info: initalizes with "invalid ID" message, but given the URL id input, it shows actor details
-Search: basic search page which allows user to look up both actors and movies

Most of these pages are very self-explanatory. However, just to clarify, the user can add comments to a movie in two ways.
The user can find the movie via Search and follow the Add Comment/Review link. 
He/she can also directly access the Add Movie Comment page, manually select the movie via dropdown, then comment/review it.
The Show Actor/Movie Info pages don't show anything unless a person ID is explicitly specified in the URL.


My thoughts:
--------------------
This project was slightly more difficult than before and rather time consuming, especially since I did the entire project by myself.
It's an interesting project, however, and I would have loved to focus more on CSS and ease of use given the chance.
