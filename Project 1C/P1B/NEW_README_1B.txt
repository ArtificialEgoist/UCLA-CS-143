I am not working with anyone at the moment. 

Project 1B
--------------------
Not too much has changed. I made a few more fields NOT NULL and changed the check constraints a bit.

For example, Actors need a full (first and last) name now. For my 1B turn in, I allowed parts of the
name to blank in order to account for certain cultures that don't have the same first/last name system
as the U.S. However, it seems like all entries have a full name, so I updated it.

I also changed the movie year check to be between 1800 and 2100, exclusive.
This is to allow old movies (I think the first credited movie is 1878?) and future ones as well.

Lastly, I changed the rating check from a 1-10 scale to 1 to 5, inclusive.
